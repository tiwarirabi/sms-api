	1) create a new route for user signup inside AuthRouter
		new controller inside auth controller which will handle signup
		email, first name, middle name, last name, password, mobile, gender

	merge to master

	2) (working on it, branch: token-db-save) after login when we generate new token, if a new refresh token is being created, save it in the database using tokenService

	when validating refresh token, first validate if the isExpired is true or false, 
		if isExpired is false
			check if the refreshToken in the body has expired or not
				if expired 
					set the database isExpired to true and respond with AuthForbiddenError
				else
					create new refresh token and access token
		if isExpired is true
			respond with a AuthForbiddenError

			How to Recreate ?
				TRUNCATE TABLE token;
				Login to auth/
				check if the access token has expired in 60 seconds
				if the accessTooken has expired 
				request new access token using the refreshToken in auth/token
				we get an refresh token invalid error even if it hasn't been time for refreshToken expiry.
				database also doesn't have hasExpired === 1;
